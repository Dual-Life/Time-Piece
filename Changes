        - fix installation target; now installs to site in v5.12 and later
        - make Time::Seconds match its VERSION to Time::Piece
        - numerous portability fixes imported from perl core distribution

1.20
        - Fix for alloca broke Solaris
        - Fixed documentation buggette about strptime
        - Added ->pretty() method for Time::Seconds objects
        - Add %s support to strptime

1.19
        - Fix for alloca broke FreeBSD

1.18
        - Fix for alloca on IRIX

1.17
        - Force all to use internal strptime then everyone gets %z even OSX
          users.
        - Finally figured out the timezone test failures on Win32 and fixed
          them.

1.16
        - Implement %z for the internal implementation of strptime().
          Unfortunately this doesn't get picked up everywhere, so there are
          no tests for it (yet - patches welcome).
        - Fix for major bug in add_months() using negative months which were
          multiples of 12. Also affected add_years() with negative years.
        - Fix for object creation bug in get_epochs which called new from
          object but that wasn't supported in the new() code.
        - Added docs about the weakness of using epoch seconds internally
          and suggested alternatives.
        - Removed useless "use UNIVERSAL qw(isa)" line.
        - Fix for installing over core perl version.

1.15
        - Skip a test on Win32 that there's just no way of passing
        - Document the above failure

1.14
        - rework add_months() to not rely on strptime being able to parse
          illegal dates (Gisle Aas).

1.13

        - A number of fixes for strptime
        - Fixed docs wrt Time::Object references

        - Ported test suite to Test.pm finally

1.01
